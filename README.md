#Redis Worker Queue Implementation
Overview
This project demonstrates a robust worker queue system using Redis, with an Express.js backend. The system is designed to efficiently manage tasks, ensuring that work is distributed across available workers. If a worker crashes, tasks remain in the queue until a worker becomes available again, simulating a real-world scenario.

Features
Task Queue: All incoming tasks are stored in a Redis queue, managed by the Express backend.
Worker Distribution: Tasks are randomly assigned to available workers, ensuring balanced load distribution.
Crash Recovery: If a worker crashes, tasks remain in the queue until the worker is back online, at which point tasks are reassigned.
Prerequisites
Docker installed on your machine
Node.js and npm installed
Setup Instructions
1. Start Redis
Begin by launching a fresh Redis instance. You can use Docker to spin up Redis:

bash
Copy code
docker run --name my-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
2. Run the Express Backend
Navigate to the express-backend directory and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd express-backend
npm install
Start the Express server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
3. Start Worker Logic
Open a new terminal for each worker you want to start. Navigate to the worker-logic directory, install dependencies, and start the worker:

bash
Copy code
cd worker-logic
npm install
npm start
4. Simulate Work Distribution
Use Postman or any other API testing tool to send requests to the Express backend. The tasks will be queued and randomly assigned to available workers.

5. Handling Worker Crashes
To simulate real-world scenarios, you can manually terminate a worker process. The tasks assigned to the terminated worker will remain in the queue until a worker is back online. Once a new or existing worker resumes, the tasks will be reassigned.

Use Case
Start multiple workers in separate terminals.
Send multiple tasks via Postman.
Observe how the tasks are randomly distributed among workers.
Simulate a worker crash by terminating one of the worker processes.
Watch as tasks pile up in the queue and get reassigned when the worker is back online.
Future Enhancements
Implement task prioritization in the queue.
Add monitoring and alerting for worker crashes.
Integrate a UI for easier task management.
